# GAN_Transformer

### The project at hand takes a baseline Generative Adversarial Network, as well as an altered version of this network that contains a transformer within the discriminator portion of the GAN, performed on image datasets. 

### The desired result is to show the effect that the transformer adds to the results, achieving better results with shorter computational time.

### The first thing needed is a dataset of images, the main dataset we will be working with is Cifar10, which is publicly available through Keras (it will be downloaded dynamically within the code). 

### If you want to run these tests with your own image files I will leave some documentation and files at the end to address the changes necessary to do so. They will be labeled beginning the the word "custom".
